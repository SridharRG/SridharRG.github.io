# Hacktivist 
Social network for those who want to change the world

# What is the need for this platform?
- There is a general need to give a streamlined (opinionated) experience to budding
  hacktivists to improve their understanding and exposure to the digital
  commons.
- There is need for a public facing platform to incentivize and guide beginners
  to the world of ethical technology.
- When the businesses are creating consumer bases, acquiring mind share over
  developers and encouraging the programmers to give their free labour for
  exploitative practices and products, they are able to do so only with the use
  of scientific and data backed approaches in the field of marketing. The
  movement too needs to approach community building and engagement in a data
  backed scientific manner but this data should be voluntarily contributed and
  ethically managed.
- This approach needs to be in sync with the latest theory on using digital
  commons as a leverage to challenge & erode capitalism (CBPP, P2P et all)
- There is a need for a global solidarity amongst movements working on ground to
  come together to share news & resources. While the fediverse is a beautiful
  initiative to this front, a more streamlined / opinionated approach can do
  more good.

# Why should Coopon Scitech take this up?
- Every dedicated commons effort requires, a dedicated community around it, such
  community needs source of resources for it sustain. Coopon being a tech coop
  is in a perfect place to engage in directed, consistent action over period of
  time while using the returns from the platform to sustain the efforts.
- Coopon, when seen as an embodiment of the best values of the Free Software
  Movment, it should act as a bridge between multiple isolated communities to
  come together to a common platform to share news, resources and work.

# What should the role of the movement be in development of the platform?
- As the platform is developed as FOSS, the movement should first engage in the
  ideation process to clear out its needs. Second, it should also engage in the
  development of the platform to ensure the platform is ready ASAP.

# What should the role of the movement be in everyday usage?
- The movement, specifically stakeholder organizations, should insist on the
  usage of the platform by its members and community. This ensures the mass
  usage of the platform.
- They should critically analyse the platform, compare it to the daily needs of
  the movement and give feedback to the developing team to make the necessary
  changes ASAP. These changes should be distinguished by their scope - local or
  global and acoordingly actions should be taken.
