### Wheel

yes, wheel

One of the Man's greatest invention of all time. Our very basic movement will somehow have wheel in our life. It has been our day-to-day essential one for work.

Let us go back to man's early history. At first man tame animals for his use. The first animal to be tamed was the dog. It watch and warned the master approcaching danger

Man soon discovered that pack of dogs could pull a fairly heavy load. He made a frame of sticks, placed loads on it and made dogs pull it. This vechicle is called sledge. It is usually used in smooth surface like snow. This came into practice in Northern Europe where sledges made of bark or hallowed tree-trunks were used. 

In Egpyt and Syria skedges were used for shifting huge stone statues even after wheel were adopted for chariots and wagons

Then man took inportant step in history of transportation. Rolling motion is far better than sliding motion because it reduces friction considerably.
