I love the journey as its not all about the desitnation and its also about our travel in our jouney.

When we board our train, We were having a nice chitchat about some random things that we usually talks about.

The last time we were returning from Kozhikode to Pondy, we were witnessing the aweful large mountains throughtout the way near palakad and all were enjoying the moment in our train journey. That time when we were travelling we booking sleeper as there were more people out there.

But this time we booked our jounery from CLT to MAS and the starting we were about to board is at 3.10a.m from station. Our internship mentor Arun sir boked a cab for us and started our journey from NITC at 2p.m and reached the railway station by 2.24a.m(we paid around 1200 for 3 sadly) and boarded our train by 3.30. By morning(06/07/2024) 6o'clock we kept and alarm to witness the view, after the palakad junction, and were having the beautiful scenario of the mountains surrounded with clouds all over the mountains. It was so aweful to watch.
