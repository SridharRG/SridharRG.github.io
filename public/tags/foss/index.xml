      <description>Started with my first wiki contribution For a long time, I was planning to contribute wikipedia as a part of my archival process and long term helpful journey that people would benefit outta it, and then our collective hosted a mediawiki called FSHM wiki which inturn paved my path to contribute it. But I dont have a list of concrete plan to contribute considering my landscape.&#xA;By then, I get to see wiki page of Fosscell NITC, which they have a list of Campus guide which seems informational and helpful to anyone who wanna join there as a fresher.</description>

      <description>Why I started using it?? I started using it because I found it cool and I wanted to be so too. It is also less of a pain in the butt compared to Windows. I got used to the Linux way of doing things and I find the way Linux does many things like&#xA;It just works as the way I want the way I install programs the complete freedom of it the transparent nature of it all more appealing than Windows’ way of doing things.</description>
