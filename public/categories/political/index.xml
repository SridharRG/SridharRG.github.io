      <description> This question always strikes me, whenever people over here are apolitical&#xA;they are comfortable with the current political climate people doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about how society is functioning or they may be extremely priveledged they will throw money and think that their problem disappear and not the society problem. they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the social issues around them becasue it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect them. they may be willfully ignorant and they avoid forming opinion because it will burst their precious priveledged bubble </description>

      <description>I love the journey as its not all about the desitnation and its also about our travel in our jouney.&#xA;When we board our train, We were having a nice chitchat about some random things that we usually talks about.&#xA;The last time we were returning from Kozhikode to Pondy, we were witnessing the aweful large mountains throughtout the way near palakad and all were enjoying the moment in our train journey.</description>
