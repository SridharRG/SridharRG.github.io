# Bixxzy

Welcome home, kutties üèéÔ∏èüí®

Elloww, Bixxzy here. A smol linux and foss enthusiaist.
 I consider this as a way to express myself, and a platform to share my thoughts. This site is a reflection of who I am, what I do, and what I love. It's a space where I can be myself. This will be my minimalistic blog and also this can be considered as my journal sometimes. Concepts like [100 days to offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) really make me want to put out more of my thoughts into writing.
